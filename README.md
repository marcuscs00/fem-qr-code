## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use the `box-shadow` property to created the box shadow under the `.wrapper` div.

I learned how to use CSS grid to center the QR Code component vertically and horizontally:

```
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to know if I'm keeping with HTML and CSS best practices.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Useful for looking up information on CSS properties.
